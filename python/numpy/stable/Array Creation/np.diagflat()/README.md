# NumPy Array Creation Methods

## `np.diagflat`

The `np.diagflat` method creates a 2D array with the elements of a given 1D array placed on the specified diagonal. You can also specify which diagonal to place the elements on.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D diagonal array from a 1D array
arr = np.diagflat([1, 2, 3])
```
