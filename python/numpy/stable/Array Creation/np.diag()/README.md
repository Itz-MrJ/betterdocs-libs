# NumPy Array Creation Methods

## `np.diag`

The `np.diag` method either extracts the diagonal of a matrix or creates a diagonal matrix from a 1D array. You can specify which diagonal to extract or place the elements on.

### Example

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a diagonal matrix
arr = np.diag([1, 2, 3])
```
