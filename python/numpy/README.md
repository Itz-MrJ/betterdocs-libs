# NumPy Library Documentation - BetterDocs

This documentation has been customized by [BetterDocs](https://betterdocs.tech/) to provide a simplified overview of the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical computing in Python. NumPy is a powerful library used for handling large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

NumPy provides a high-performance array object, `ndarray`, and tools for integrating with other languages like C, C++, and Fortran. It also supports a variety of mathematical operations such as linear algebra, statistical analysis, Fourier analysis, and much more.

## Features:
- **ndarray**: A fast, flexible container for large datasets.
- **Mathematical operations**: Efficient operations on arrays like addition, multiplication, and more complex functions like matrix factorization, polynomial evaluation, and Fourier transforms.
- **Random sampling**: Generate random numbers from various distributions.
- **Linear algebra**: Tools for working with matrices, including matrix multiplication, determinants, eigenvalues, etc.
- **Integration**: Interface with other languages and libraries like C, C++, Fortran, and more.
- **Broadcasting**: A method that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations.
