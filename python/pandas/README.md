# Pandas Library Documentation - BetterDocs

This documentation has been customized by [BetterDocs](https://betterdocs.tech/) to provide a simplified overview of the Pandas library, which is essential for data manipulation and analysis in Python. Pandas is a powerful library that provides data structures and functions needed to work on structured data seamlessly.

Pandas is built on top of NumPy and offers easy-to-use data structures like Series and DataFrame, designed to handle a variety of data formats, from CSV and Excel files to databases, while supporting powerful data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis functionalities.

## Features:
- **DataFrame**: A 2D labeled data structure that supports a wide variety of data types, perfect for structured data.
- **Series**: A one-dimensional labeled array, ideal for representing a single column of a DataFrame or other types of indexed data.
- **Data manipulation**: Efficient tools for reshaping, merging, and joining datasets, including filtering, grouping, and aggregating data.
- **Missing data handling**: Built-in support for detecting, handling, and filling missing data.
- **File I/O**: Read and write data from a variety of file formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL databases, and more.
- **Time series analysis**: Tools for working with dates and times, including date ranges, frequency conversion, and time shifting.
- **Data visualization**: Integration with Matplotlib for plotting data directly from DataFrames and Series.
