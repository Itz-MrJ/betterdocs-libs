# Pandas Methods - BetterDocs

This documentation has been customized by [BetterDocs](https://betterdocs.tech/) for a simplified overview of various Pandas methods. These methods provide powerful tools for creating and manipulating data structures such as Series and DataFrame, as well as reading and writing data from various formats.

The following Pandas methods are available:

- **`pd.Series`**: Create a one-dimensional labeled array, ideal for a single column of a DataFrame or any indexed data.
- **`pd.DataFrame`**: Create a two-dimensional labeled data structure, commonly used for working with tabular data.
- **`pd.read_pickle`**: Read a pickled object from a file and load it into a DataFrame or Series.
- **`pd.read_table`**: Read a table of data from a file, with a delimiter of your choice (e.g., tab-separated values).
- **`pd.read_csv`**: Read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_fwf`**: Read data from a fixed-width file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_clipboard`**: Read tabular data from the system clipboard and load it into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_excel`**: Read data from an Excel file (both `.xls` and `.xlsx`) into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.ExcelFile.parse`**: Parse a specific sheet from an Excel file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_json`**: Read data from a JSON file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.json_normalize`**: Normalize semi-structured JSON data into a flat table.
- **`pd.read_html`**: Read HTML tables from a webpage into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_xml`**: Read data from an XML file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_hdf`**: Read data from an HDF5 file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_feather`**: Read data from a Feather file format into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_parquet`**: Read data from a Parquet file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_orc`**: Read data from an ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) file into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_sql_table`**: Read data from an SQL table into a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_sql_query`**: Execute a SQL query and return the result as a DataFrame.
- **`pd.read_sql`**: Read data from an SQL database into a DataFrame.
